To properly use Twilio's services for this demo, a valid account_sid and authorization token is needed. This can be obtained in two ways.

Create a Twilio Account:

You will need three items, which go directly into the twilio configuration file:
	Account SID
	Auth Token
	Phone Number

Account SID and Auth Token:

Once you have made a Twilio account, go to their home page. You will find a menu option at the top to access the account console.
https://www.twilio.com/console

Phone Number:

Once you're in the console, you want to get a phone number.
https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming


Once you have these numbers, you want to change the configuration. 
The configuration file is: "chefboyrd/controllers/sms.cfg"

account_sid = {Your Account SID}
auth_token = {Your Auth Token}
restaurant_phone_number: {Your phone Number}


Example sms.cfg file:

[keys]
account_sid: AC9e9804140123ad494f9f0g01aeb57be4
auth_token: eb0996987502g6d378a3f8f2dbaef179 
[test]
cust_phone_number: +17326050815
restaurant_phone_number: +10093325081




The last thing you need to do is configure your Twilio to send a Request when a text message is received.
Go to your Phone Numbers Section in your Account Console.
Click on your active phone number.

under the header:
A MESSAGE COMES IN

select Webhook

type in http://{Your server web address}/feedbackM/twiliosms

select HTTP POST


This configures Twilio so that their service will send a HTTP POST request to that website url with the message details. This will happen in real-time when a message is received by Twilio.



If you're running a server from localhost, I highly recommend using ngrok to set up a tunnel to a public IP address

You won't be charged for the first 2000 text messages that are sent or received on twilio. You can read more about Twilio's free trial policy here.
