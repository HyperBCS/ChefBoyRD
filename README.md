##Description:

This restaurant automation application, ChefBoyRD, (ChefBoy Restaurant Development) is a software program that offers solutions to the specific problems. These problems include, improving business efficiency by reducing food waste, improviding feedback submissions and processing, and improving the customer experience with a reservation system. The relevant results generated by the program will be accessible by employees, e.g. chefs will have access to dish prediction, hosts and hostesses will see reservations. All of the program’s functions can be centrally monitored by the manager.
